## React and Fetch: Intro
##### Due Wednesday, March 23, 2016  
###### Fetch and Post API with React

We'll be creating a React component that loads a list of images and then lists them on a page.

The Giphy API can be called using the following URL: 
`http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=taylor+swift&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC`

1. Create a [JSBin (add JSX)](http://jsbin.com/) or an arbiter
2. Create a React component, where the componentDidMount will fetch the API above
3. After it fetches, set the state of the React component to the images array from Giphy
4. The React Component should render() the images.
